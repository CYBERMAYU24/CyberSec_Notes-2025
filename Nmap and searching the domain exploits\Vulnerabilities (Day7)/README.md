# Nmap Commands Guide for L1 - L2 - L3

## 1. TARGET SPECIFICATION

* `-iL <inputfilename>` : Input from list of IPs/hosts/networks.

## 2. HOST DISCOVERY

* `-sL` : List Scan - Simply lists targets to scan.
* `-sn` : Ping Scan - Disables port scan, only checks host availability.
* `-Pn` : Treat all hosts as online, skip host discovery.

## 3. SCAN TECHNIQUES

* `-sS / -sT / -sA` : TCP SYN / Connect() / ACK scans.
* `-sU` : UDP Scan.

## 4. PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER

* `-p <port ranges>` : Only scan specified ports.
  **Examples:**

  * `-p 22` : Scan port 22.
  * `-p 1-65535` : Scan all ports.
  * `-p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080,5:9` : Scan specific UDP and TCP ports.

* `--exclude-ports <port ranges>` : Exclude the specified ports from scanning.

* `-F` : Fast mode, scans fewer ports than the default.

* `-r` : Scan ports sequentially (do not randomize).

## 5. SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION

* `-sV` : Probe open ports to determine service/version info.
* `--version-intensity <level>` : Set intensity level (0-9), higher tries more probes.
* `--version-light` : Limit to most likely probes (intensity 2).
* `--version-all` : Try every probe (intensity 9).
* `--version-trace` : Show detailed version scan activity (for debugging).

## 6. SCRIPT SCAN

* `-sC` : Equivalent to using default scripts.
* `--script=<NSE-name.nse>` : <Lua scripts> Is a Comma seperated list of directories, script-files or script-categories.

## 7. TIMING AND PERFORMANCE

* `-T<0-5>` : Set timing template.

  * **Higher number = Faster scan.**

## 8. OS DETECTION

* `-O` : Enable OS detection.

## 9. OUTPUT

* `-oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file>` : Output scan in Normal (txt), XML, scripty, or grepable format.
* `-v` : Increase verbosity level.
* `-v` : Level 1 (basic real-time report).
* `-vv` : Level 2 (recommended).
* `-vvv` : Level 3 (detailed real-time report).

## 10. MISCELLANEOUS

* `-A` : Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

# Additional Key Concepts

## üîå What is a Port?

A **port** is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports help computers differentiate between different kinds of traffic (like HTTP, FTP, SSH) using **port numbers**.
Example:

* Port 80: HTTP (Web Traffic)
* Port 22: SSH (Remote Access)

## üìå JIRA

**JIRA** is a popular project management tool developed by Atlassian, widely used for:

* **Issue tracking**
* **Bug tracking**
* **Agile project management (like Scrum & Kanban boards)**

---

## üåê Shodan.io

**Shodan** is a powerful search engine for discovering devices connected to the internet (like webcams, servers, routers). It is often called the "Google for hackers" because:

* It shows open ports, services, banners, vulnerabilities, etc.
* You can search for unsecured or misconfigured devices.

## üñäÔ∏è Mousepad Command

`mousepad` is a simple text editor for Linux, mainly used in lightweight desktop environments like XFCE.
**Command to open:**

```bash
mousepad <filename>
```

If no filename is given, it opens a blank file for quick editing.

## üîé searchsploit

**searchsploit** is a command-line search tool to find exploits and vulnerabilities from the Exploit Database.
**Example Command:**

```bash
searchsploit vsftpd
```

This will list known exploits related to the vsftpd service.
