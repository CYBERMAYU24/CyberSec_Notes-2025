## 📌 Types of Cybersecurity Threats

### 1. **Phishing**

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where the attacker pretends to be a legitimate entity—like a bank, company, or even a friend—to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, OTPs, or credit card numbers.
**Examples:**

* Fake emails that look like PayPal or your bank asking you to "verify" your account.
* WhatsApp messages with fake job offers that ask for personal details.

---

### 2. **Ransomware**

Ransomware is a type of malware that locks or encrypts a user's files and demands a ransom to unlock them. Victims may lose access to personal files, and organizations may lose customer data or entire systems.
**Key Features:**

* Encrypted files with `.locked`, `.crypt`, or other extensions.
* A ransom note asking for Bitcoin or other crypto.

**Real Incidents:**

* **WannaCry (2017):** Affected hospitals, banks, and companies worldwide.

---

### 3. **Malware**

Malware (short for "malicious software") refers to any software that is designed to harm or exploit a computer or network.
**Types of Malware:**

* **Virus**: Attaches itself to files and spreads.
* **Worm**: Spreads without user action, often across networks.
* **Trojan Horse**: Disguised as legitimate software.
* **Spyware**: Monitors user activity and steals data.

---

### 4. **Social Engineering**

Social engineering is the act of manipulating people into giving away confidential info. Instead of attacking computers, attackers "hack humans" by preying on trust, fear, or urgency.
**Common Tricks:**

* Fake calls claiming to be "tech support"
* Asking for OTPs or passwords under pressure
* Pretending to be someone from your workplace

---

### 5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**

In a MITM attack, the attacker secretly intercepts or alters communication between two parties. The victims believe they're talking directly to each other.
**Example:**

* You connect to public Wi-Fi. The hacker is the middleman between you and the actual site.
* They can read your messages, steal passwords, or inject malware.

---

### 6. **Zero-day Attack**

A zero-day attack exploits a software vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor. Since the developers are unaware, there’s no patch available, making the attack extremely dangerous.
**Used in:**

* Espionage
* Cyber warfare
* High-level hacking operations

**Term Explanation:**
“Zero-day” means the developers have had **zero days** to fix it.
