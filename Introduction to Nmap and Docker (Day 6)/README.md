## üåê Open Web UI Docker

When running a **Dockerized** app (like Uptime Kuma), many tools provide a **Web UI (User Interface)** to easily manage and visualize the service.

* **How it works:**

  * The Docker container exposes a specific **port** (like `http://localhost:3001`).
  * You can open this link in your browser to access the application dashboard.
* **Example Command:**

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --name uptime-kuma louislam/uptime-kuma
  ```

  You can then open the web UI at: `http://localhost:3001`

## üö™ Docker Nginx Reverse Proxy

**Nginx Reverse Proxy** forwards client requests to backend services running in Docker.

* **Why Use It?**

  * To route multiple services on the same server using different domains or subdomains.
  * For example:

    ```
    yourdomain.com --> Uptime Kuma container
    api.yourdomain.com --> API container
    ```

* **Benefits:**

  * Centralized request management
  * SSL termination (HTTPS)

* **Example Docker Setup:**

  ```yaml
  services:
    nginx:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
      volumes:
        - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

  You can configure Nginx to direct traffic to your running Docker containers based on the request domain or path.

  ```bash
  sudo nmap -O <ip/domain>
  ```

* **Purpose:**
  Detects the **operating system (OS)** of the target machine.
