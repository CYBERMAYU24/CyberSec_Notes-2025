# 🌐 Day 01 - Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Welcome to Day 1 of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp. This session introduces the foundational concepts of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Here's a quick overview and key takeaways for Level 1 learners.

---

## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs** from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are typically aimed at:

* Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information
* Interrupting normal business operations
* Extorting money from users or organizations

Effective cybersecurity requires a **layered defense** strategy across computers, networks, and applications.

## 🎯 3 Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity professionals often specialize in one of three main domains:

| Domain          | Color Team   | Role Description                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blue Team**   | 🟦 Defensive | Protects systems from attacks. Involves monitoring, detection, and response.                  |
| **Red Team**    | 🟥 Offensive | Simulates real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers.                    |
| **Purple Team** | 🟪 Hybrid    | Bridges the gap between red and blue teams. Facilitates communication and strategy alignment. |

### 🔴 Red Team — **Offensive Security**

#### 📌 What They Do:

* Emulate real attackers to **find vulnerabilities** in systems, applications, or people (social engineering).
* Perform **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing** to expose weak points.
* Help organizations discover “what could go wrong” before it actually does.

#### 🛠️ Common Tools:

* **Metasploit**, **Burp Suite**, **Nmap**, **Kali Linux**, **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**

#### 🌍 Real-World Scenario:

> A fintech company hires a Red Team to simulate a phishing campaign. The Red Team sends fake emails with a malicious link to employees. Some employees click it — the team now gains access to internal systems and documents how they did it.
> ➤ The goal: Show how an attacker might succeed, so the company can fix it.

---

### 🔵 Blue Team — **Defensive Security**

#### 📌 What They Do:

* Monitor systems and networks for suspicious activity
* Create incident response plans and perform digital forensics
* Configure firewalls, IDS/IPS, and harden servers against intrusion

#### 🛠️ Common Tools:

* **Wireshark**, **Splunk**, **OSSEC**, **Snort**, **ELK Stack**, **SIEM systems**

#### 🌍 Real-World Scenario:

> After noticing repeated login attempts from Russia at 3AM, the Blue Team at a healthcare provider launches an investigation. They block IPs, analyze logs, and notify stakeholders. They also update firewall rules and scan for malware.
> ➤ The goal: Defend and recover quickly, with minimal impact.

---

### 🟣 Purple Team — **Coordination & Integration**

#### 📌 What They Do:

* Combine Red and Blue Team efforts
* Analyze attack simulations and responses
* Improve overall detection, logging, communication, and resilience

#### 🛠️ Common Tools:

* Use a mix of Red and Blue tools + collaboration platforms like **MISP**, **Jira**, **MITRE ATT\&CK Navigator**

#### 🌍 Real-World Scenario:

> The Red Team runs a simulated ransomware attack. The Blue Team detects it, but response time is slow. The Purple Team steps in, analyzes where delays happened, tunes alerting systems, and improves endpoint detection.
> ➤ The goal: Make Red smarter and Blue stronger.

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Team           | Focus      | Activities                        | Goal                      |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 🔴 Red Team    | Attack     | Exploit weaknesses (legally)      | Find vulnerabilities      |
| 🔵 Blue Team   | Defend     | Monitor, detect, and respond      | Protect systems/data      |
| 🟣 Purple Team | Coordinate | Facilitate and improve both sides | Optimize security posture |
