# 🌐 Day 01 - Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Welcome to Day 1 of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp. This session introduced the foundational concepts of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Here's a quick overview and takeaways for Level 1 learners.

## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs** from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at:

- Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information
- Interrupting normal business processes
- Extorting money from users or organizations

Effective cybersecurity requires a **layered defense** spread across computers, networks, and programs.

## 🎯 3 Domains in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity professionals often specialize in one of three main domains:

| Domain       | Color Team | Role Description |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Blue Team** | 🟦 Defensive | Protects systems from attacks. Involves monitoring, detection, and response. |
| **Red Team**  | 🟥 Offensive | Simulates real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers. |
| **Purple Team** | 🟪 Hybrid | Bridges the gap between red and blue teams. Facilitates communication and strategy alignment. |

### 🔴 Red Team

**Focus:** Offensive Security
**Key Activities:** Ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation

**🧠 Real-World Scenario:**
Imagine a financial company wants to test how secure their customer portal is. A Red Team mimics real-world attackers by trying to bypass login mechanisms, exploit web app vulnerabilities, or use phishing emails to gain internal access—all without causing real damage. Their job is to find cracks before criminals do.

### 🔵 Blue Team

**Focus:** Defensive Security
**Key Activities:** Threat detection, incident response, system hardening

**🧠 Real-World Scenario:**
After noticing suspicious login attempts from foreign IPs, the Blue Team of a hospital IT department investigates the logs, blocks the IPs, and strengthens firewall rules. They also perform forensic analysis to ensure no data breach occurred. Their job is to protect and respond fast.

---

### 🟣 Purple Team

**Focus:** Integration and Collaboration
**Key Activities:** Bridge between Red and Blue Teams, optimize detection and defense strategies

**🧠 Real-World Scenario:**
In a tech company, the Red Team simulates a ransomware attack, and the Blue Team responds. Afterward, the Purple Team analyzes both strategies—suggesting better logging mechanisms, patch schedules, and user awareness training. They ensure both teams learn and evolve.
