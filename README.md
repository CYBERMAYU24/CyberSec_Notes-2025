## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs** from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at:

- Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information
- Interrupting normal business processes
- Extorting money from users or organizations

Effective cybersecurity requires a **layered defense** spread across computers, networks, and programs.
