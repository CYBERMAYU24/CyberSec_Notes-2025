## 1. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. Instead of manually setting an IP for each device, DHCP ensures every device gets a unique IP automatically.

* 📌 Example: When your phone connects to Wi-Fi, DHCP gives it an IP like `192.168.1.10`.
* 🎯 Saves time and reduces IP conflicts.

## 2. **MAC ID (Media Access Control Address)**

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network interface card (NIC). It’s like a fingerprint for your device on a network.

* 📌 Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
* 🔒 Used for identifying and controlling access to the network.

## 3. **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**

An ISP is a company that provides access to the Internet. They assign public IP addresses and provide services like broadband, fiber, or mobile internet.

* 🏢 Examples: Jio, Airtel, BSNL
* 📡 ISPs connect your home or device to the global internet.

## 4. **Hub**

A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network. It broadcasts incoming data to **all** connected devices.

* ⚠️ Less secure and slower than a switch.
* 🧠 Does not filter or manage traffic – just passes it along.

---

## 5. **Subnet (Subnetwork)**

A subnet is a smaller network inside a larger one. It helps in organizing and optimizing network traffic.

* 📌 Example: `192.168.1.0/24` means all IPs from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`.
* ⚙️ Helps in routing and managing IP addresses more efficiently.

---

## 6. **Loopback IP (127.0.0.1)**

This is a special IP address used to test your own machine's network stack.

* 📍 `127.0.0.1` is always your own system.
* 🧪 Useful for testing software or configurations locally.

---

## 7. **Capture The Flag (CTF)**

CTF is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find “flags” (secret strings).

* 🛡️ Topics: cryptography, reverse engineering, web hacking, forensics, etc.
* 🏁 Flags look like: `flag{this_is_a_sample}`
